Typical examples are discrete-choice models (binary, multinomial, ordered outcomes), sample selection models (censored or truncated outcomes), and count-data models (integer outcomes). The course describes the estimation and interpretation of these models. It also shows how the discrete-choice models can emerge from (structural) random-utility frameworks. This course has been developed by Jean-Paul Renne. It is illustrated by R codes using various packages that can be obtained from CRAN. This AEC package is available on GitHub.
